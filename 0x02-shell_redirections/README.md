# Shell, I/O Redirections and filters

In this project, I learned about using the `head`, `tail`, `find`, `wc`, `sort`,
`uniq`, `grep`, and `tr` commands to redirect standard input and output and
combine commands in the Shell. Further, I saw how special characters
work and how to filter text from files.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Hello World**
  * [0-hello_world](./0-hello_world): Bash script that prints "Hello, World"
  followed by a new line to the standard output.
