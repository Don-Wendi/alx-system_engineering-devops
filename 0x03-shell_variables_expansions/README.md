# Shell, init files, variables and expansions

In this project, I learned about initialization files, local, global, and
reserved variables, and special parameters in the Shell. I also practiced on
using expansions, performing arithmetic operations, and utilizing aliases.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. <o>**
  * [0-alias](./0-alias): Bash script that creates an alias named `ls` with value `rm *`.

* **2. The path to success is to take massive, determined action**
  * [2-path](./2-path): Bash script that adds `/action` to the `PATH`.
