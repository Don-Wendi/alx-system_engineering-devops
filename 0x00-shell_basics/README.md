# Shell, basics

I took a crash course in the Shell as part of this project. I learned how to browse about using `ls`, `less`, and `file`, navigate directories using `cd`, `pwd`, and alter files using `cp`,

`mv`, `rm`, and `mkdir.` I also worked with the Bash commands `type`, `which`, `help`, and `man`, as well as using wildcards, reading man pages, making links, and using keyboard shortcuts.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Where am I?**
  * [0-current_working_directory](./0-current_working_directory): Bash script that
  prints the absolute pathname of the current working directory.
